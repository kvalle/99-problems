-- | Problem 10
--
-- Run-length encoding of a list. Use the result of problem P09 to implement the so-called

-- | Problem 13
--
-- Run-length encoding of a list (direct solution).
--
-- Implement the so-called run-length encoding data compression method directly. 
-- I.e. don't explicitly create the sublists containing the duplicates, as in problem 9, but only count 
-- them. As in problem P11, simplify the result list by replacing the singleton lists (1 X) by X.
